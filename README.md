# â˜• Coffee Shop Domain Modeling (Python OOP Project)

This project models a simple **Coffee Shop domain** using Python's Object-Oriented Programming principles. It defines core entities: Customer, Coffee, and Order, and establishes the relationships and business logic between them.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create and manage Customer, Coffee, and Order objects.
- Enforce validation on attributes (name lengths, price range, types).
- Many-to-many relationships via orders.
- Aggregated statistics (number of orders, average price).
- Class method to find the top-spending customer for a specific coffee.
